    "## Loops\n",
    "A common task in Python is looping or *iterating* through a collection of objects using a `for` loop. This extremely powerful tool lets you act on hundreds, thousands or even millions of objects with just a few lines of code. Those objects could be the characters in a `string`, the objects in a `list`, the numbers in a `range`, the rows in a data file, the files in a directory and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run and study this code:"

   "source": [
    "numlist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "for item in numlist:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "print('All done!')"
   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "You probably can figure out what's going on here: We have a `list` of five numbers. We then use a `for` loop to *iterate* over this `list` and print each number. But there are three things we need to take a closer look at: the word `item`, the colon at the end of our `for` statement and the four blank spaces at the beginning of the first `print` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, `item` is just a variable name and has no special meaning. We could have called it anything: `x`, `num`, `spam` and so on. Each time Python iterates through our `list`, `item` is pointed to the next value. When Python has finished running the `for` loop, it promptly forgets `item` ever existed. In fact, if you tried to access the value of `item` outside the `for` loop, you'd get an error rather than 5. This is due to something called `scope`. We won't cover `scope` here, but in a nutshell: Because `item` was created as part of the `for` loop, it's discarded once the `for` loop has finished running.\n",
    "\n",
    "The colon is used to separate the first line of the `for` statement from the code that will be run against each item in our `list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the spaces, spacing is very important in Python programs. Notice that there is no code to tell Python when it has reached the end of the `for` loop. This is because the spacing does that. This is why `All done!` is printed only once instead of five times. If we indented that last `print` statement, it would be printed five times: once after each value. (Feel free to try that out, if you like. We'll wait.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use four spaces each time you indent your code. Technically you can use any number of spaces as long as you are consistent, but four space is standard practice among Python programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even nest a `for` loop inside another `for` loop. In the box below, create another `list` called `sublist` with string values `a`, `b` and `c`. For every value in `numlist`, `print` that value and each value in `sublist` in this format: `print(<numlist value>, <sublist value>)` When you're done, print: `All done!`"

    "## Functions\n",
    "Functions are snippets of code -- usually tiny snippets of code -- that ideally do only one thing but do it very well. As you get more and more programming under your belt, you'll want to start putting more of your code into functions. Here are a few reasons why:\n",
    "<ol><li><b>Code re-use:</b> If you find yourself typing the same code over and over throughout your program, that code is a good candidate for a function. Instead of constantly retyping the same code, you type it just once and then call the same function from throughout your program.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Easier debugging:</b> If there's something wrong with your function, you have to fix your code in only one place. If you have the same code repeated throughout your program, you have to fix every instance, assuming you can find them all.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Cleaner code:</b> There's a saying that code is read a lot more often than it's written. Programs can contain thousands of lines of code. Breaking your code up into functions is an easy way to reduce complexity. That will make it easier for you and anyone else looking at your code to understand what your code is supposed to do.</li></ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a data file where 10 columns contain dollar figures. However, those dollar figures are strings rather than numbers and contain both `$` currency symbols and comma separators (i.e., `'$92,463.84'`). We want to be able to do some math on these values, so we need to convert them to numbers. What's more, we want to round these values to the nearest whole dollar. To make it even more interesting, many of the values are missing or are invalid values, such as `'n/a'` or even something like `'$93,w64,092.22'`. We want to replace all invalid values with a zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could write 10 copies of the same code -- one for each column -- to process this data, or we could write just one function and call it 10 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a function, start with the `def` keyword followed by a name for your function. (Let's call ours `clean_money_string`.) On the same line, and in parentheses, put the names of any parameters you need to pass to your function. The parameter names are just variables and should describe the data they contain. In this case, we need to pass only one parameter. Let's call it `value`. Finish the line with a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like `for` loops and `if` statements, code within a function must be nested, and a function must have at least one statement. To verify that the syntax of your function header is correct, just nest the word `pass` under the function header and run your code. `pass` is useful when you are required to input some code but don't need Python to do anything. It's also good placeholder code that you'll come back and write later."
